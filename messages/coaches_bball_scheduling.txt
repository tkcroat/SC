If your basketball team is planning to practice at the Cabrini gym, please visit the google form link below to give us your preferred practice times.
$GDRIVE_SCHEDULING

We have 6 Cabrini teams practicing at our gym and are planning to have two slots per weeknight (except single slot on Thursday due to Boy Scouts).  
Generally younger teams are given preference for the early slots.
Additional practice time may be available by appointment during the pre-season (e.g. after 8:30 on weeknights, Sat or Sun slots, Thursday 7:15 slot during the Christmas season)

Team rosters, game cards, team contact lists in Excel format and CYC card images for your team will be available on the google drive at:
