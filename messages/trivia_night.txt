The St. Frances Cabrini Sponsors Club is hosting its 15th annual trivia night on Sat. Nov. 18 at Cabrini (3022 Oregon, 63118).   
This fundraiser allows us to keep our sports fees significantly lower than any other CYC school.

Doors at 6:30PM, questions at 7PM; $20 per player payable at the door (tables of 10 max).  
If you do not have a full table, we can find a place for you.  
Beer/wine, snacks, soda are provided and tacos will again be available for purchase.
Ties are broken with a free throw contest.  
To reserve a table (or partial table) in advance, go to: bit.do/cabrinitrivia 
or send an e-mail to jlr63104@gmail.com. 

Thanks!
