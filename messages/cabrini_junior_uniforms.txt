If anyone on Cabrini K-4 soccer teams does not yet have a navy uniform T, they are available in youth medium, youth large, adult small and adult 
medium for $10.  Let me know what size you need and I'll arrange to get it to you this week.  Payment via check to "Cabrini Sponsors Club" or cash 
is fine.If you can't find the shirt for a game, you can get away with wearing another navy/dark blue T shirt.  Red shorts are also recommended, 
unless your coach prefers a different color.
