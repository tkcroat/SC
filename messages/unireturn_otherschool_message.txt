According to our records your child (or children listed below) played on another school's team and was issued one of their uniforms.  
Now that the season is over, please promptly wash and return the issued uniform to your child's coach or according to any other instructions you receive.
Also as a last resort, you can also drop uniforms off (washed and in a bag containing a note with player's name) to the office of the school on which your child played.


Thank you,
