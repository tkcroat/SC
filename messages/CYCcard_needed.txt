The deadline for ordering CYC cards online is Sept. 30.
$FIRST $LAST needs a CYC ID card to play this season and we do not have one in our files.
If your child already has this ID card, please snap a picture of it and e-mail to sfcasponsorsclub@gmail.com.
If you don't have one, you can get one online at: https://idcards.cycstl.net.  Cost is $5 and you need a picture of the 
child and a birth certificate (or other birth document).
