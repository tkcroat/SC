The 1st and 2nd grade girls team will have its first practice on Tuesday 8/29 6PM at Cherokee park.  After losing last year's 
head coach we had to rearrange teams (3rd grade girls were sent to St. Ambrose team).  We will continue with practices Tuesdays at same 
time/same place unless otherwise notified (by text and /or e-mail).  

What to bring: water bottle, shinguards (recommended for practice, required for games), optional (soccer ball with your kid’s name written on it)

Note: Bathrooms at Cherokee Park are often locked so plan ahead;

First game scheduled for Sun 9/10 2:20PM at Ackfield park. I'll send rest of schedule once it's finalized.  


Your child will need a CYC card to play on this team, which needs to be ordered online before the first game (weekend of Sept 9) at:
https://idcards.cycstl.net/.  
Cost is $5 and a picture of the child and of their birth certificate (or other birth document) is needed.  This card will be valid for 
all sports through 8th grade (one time requirement).  If you have difficulty, you can just bring the items to a practice and I can order 
it for you.  Once you receive the card, please take a picture of it and send to: sfcasponsorsclub@gmail.com
