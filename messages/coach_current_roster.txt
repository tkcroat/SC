Here are the players who will be on your $SPORT roster.  If anything is missing or incorrect let me know soon.
For teams who do not yet have uniforms we are planning Uniform Night in early Jan (just before first games 
since new boy uniforms have not yet arrived).  We have not yet been notified about league assignments.

Rosters, CYC card sheets and game cards (once available) will be posted at: $GDRIVEWINTER

Thanks,
Kevin
