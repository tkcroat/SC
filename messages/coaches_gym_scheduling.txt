$GDRIVE_SCHEDULING

We have 6 Cabrini teams practicing at our gym and are planning to have two slots per weeknight (except single slot on Thursday due to Boy Scouts).  
Generally younger teams are given preference for the early slots.
Additional practice time may be available by appointment during the pre-season (e.g. after 8:30 on weeknights, Sat or Sun slots, Thursday 7:15 slot during the Christmas season)
