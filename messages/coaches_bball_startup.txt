If your basketball team is planning to practice at the Cabrini gym, please visit the google form link below to give us your preferred practice times.
$GDRIVE_SCHEDULING

We have 6 Cabrini teams practicing at our gym and are planning to have two slots per weeknight (except single slot on Thursday due to Boy Scouts).  
Generally younger teams are given preference for the early slots.
Additional practice time may be available by appointment during the pre-season (e.g. after 8:30 on weeknights, Sat or Sun slots, Thursday 7:15 slot during the Christmas season)

CYC cards are required for all players and we have digital card images for all of your players except those listed below.  If you have one of the missing cards, please send me a picture of it.  
If not, the player may need to get one from:   

CYC cards not on file: $MISSINGCARDS
If you have any of these missing cards, please send me a picture of them.  Players new to CYC sports may need to get one at: https://idcards.cycstl.net
 
Team rosters, game cards, and CYC card images for your team will be available on the google drive at:
